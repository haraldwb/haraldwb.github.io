Hi, I&rsquo;m Harald. Thanks for checking out my page!
I developed an interest for computers and technology early on and built my first computer when I was in my early teens.
Geology is also something I enjoyed when growing up so when deciding what to study it was either computer science (CS) or going a more regular engineering path with a bit of CS.
I chose the latter and learned CS on the side."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://hboe.no/about/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.a090830a421002426baafbd314e38f149d77b4c48a12ee9312700d770b27fb26.css integrity="sha256-oJCDCkIQAkJrqvvTFOOPFJ13tMSKEu6TEnANdwsn+yY=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://hboe.no/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://hboe.no/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://hboe.no/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://hboe.no/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://hboe.no/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://hboe.no/about/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://hboe.no/about/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Harald W.
