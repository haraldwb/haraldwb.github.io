Omarchy is an arch-linux based distribution intended for developers and its quickly gaining popularity since it&rsquo;s release this summer.
The creator is David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH). DHH is the creator of Ruby on Rails and CTO of 37signals. From what I&rsquo;ve understood the reason for creating it is that he was fed up by the decline of macs and started looking into how Linux fared as a developer OS.
Well, he did indeed put together something quite awesome for developers.

Great set of default keyboard shortcuts. I have been using Omarchy for quite a few months now and I can’t recommend it enough. It’s got great traction and with the continous support from 37 Signals with DHH at the helm I foresee a great future for this distro. It truly is a joy to be using it.
